- Reduce number of variables and use v-model as much as possible
- Implement ES6 stuff like Try Catch, Arrow functions, etc. (if needed)

### To do (General)

- "Check" icons should be displayed when inputted data is good (All pages)
- Add captcha on Login/Register/ForgotPassword
- Notifications should be displayed in toasts (Dashboard & Settings)
- All buttons should be centered
- Make images for types of events
- Center (and make it) 'Loading' modal on Dashboard page;
- Make Modal as a component with slot [?]
- Make 404 page
